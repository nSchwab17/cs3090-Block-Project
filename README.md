# Block Project 2: Valid Password Checker #
## This program takes in the users password and runs through three checks varifying that it is strong enough for the application. ##

**First**, the program checks if the password is atleast 9 characters long. 
**Second**, runs through a method that counts the amount of special characters, ensuring there are atleast two somewhere in the password. 
**Lastly**, the program checks for atleast one uppercase character somewhere in the password.
